Hi!
===

You're reading https://lizard-developer-docs.readthedocs.org/ and want to
add/change/contribute something? Feel free! Github is the place to do so.

- The quickest way is to just add an issue at
  https://github.com/nens/lizarddeveloperdocs/issues . Feel free to just paste
  in some raw documentation or tell us something you're missing. Raw
  documentation is fine, we'll integrate it in the right spot and possibly
  re-word it.

- You can also make a fork or branch if you have a bigger addition and can
  write it yourself. Send a pull request and we'll integrate it.

- Quick spelling correction? When you read it on
  https://lizard-developer-docs.readthedocs.org/, you'll see an **edit on
  github** link on the left hand side. Hit it and you can fix the typo
  directly from within your browser!
