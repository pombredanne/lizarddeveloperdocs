Overview
########

**Note**: the first intention of this documentation is for use at
`Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ as a description of
what you'll need to know as a new developer. Because of this, it is of course
also very useful to everyone that wants to start working on `Lizard
<http://lizard.org>`_! You'll probably have to read around the parts where
Nelen & Schuurmans' internal server setup is discussed :-)
